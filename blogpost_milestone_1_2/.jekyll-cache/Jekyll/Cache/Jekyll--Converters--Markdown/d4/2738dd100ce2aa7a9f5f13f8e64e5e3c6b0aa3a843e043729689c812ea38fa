<p><strong>Question 1</strong>
From the tidied dataset with information of all shots and goals, we added several features: “shot distance”, “shot angle”, “is goal” and “empty net”.</p>

<p>With these information, we could plot the following figures:</p>

<p>According to the above figure, it is obvious that most shots and goals were taken from distance 5 to 70 ft, which is intuitive and reasonable. The highest number of shots and goals were at distance around 15 ft, while there were just a few shots were taken at the defensive side of each team (greater than 100 ft).</p>
