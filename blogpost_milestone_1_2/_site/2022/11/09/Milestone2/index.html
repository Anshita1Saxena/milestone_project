  <h2 id="task-2---feature-engineering-i"><strong>Task 2 - Feature Engineering I</strong></h2>

<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>From the tidied dataset with information of all shots and goals, we added several features: “shot distance”, “shot angle”, “is goal” and “empty net”.</p>

<p>With these information, we could plot the following figures:</p>

<p><strong>Shot counts by distance</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_distance.PNG" alt="shot counts by distance" /></p>

<p>According to the above figure, it is obvious that most shots and goals were taken from distance 5 to 70 ft, which is intuitive and reasonable. The highest number of shots and goals were at distance around 15 ft, while there were just a few shots were taken at the defensive side of each team (greater than 100 ft).</p>

<p><strong>Shot counts by angle</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_angle.PNG" alt="shot counts by angle" /></p>

<p>The histogram of shot counts binned by shot angle indicates that hockey shooters prefer front shots (with angle from 0 to 45 degree) than shots from the two sides with too large angle. It is understandable because if a shot is taken with a very large angle, it would easier to miss.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that there were several shots with angle greater than 90 degree. This mean the hockey players took the shots from behind the net, which is very impressive!</p>

<p><strong>Shot by both distance and angle from the net</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_distance_and_angle.PNG" alt="shot distance and angle" /></p>

<p>By combining both the feature shot distance and shot angle, we realize that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All shots from angle greater than 90 degree are taken near the net. It is obivous because the maximum distance behind the net is just around 25 ft. However, it partly proves that our feature engineering process has been done suitably.</li>
  <li>All far-distance shots were taken at angle 0 to 25 degree. This does make sense because if a hockey player shots too near from the net with very high angle, the shot would highly likely hit the goal post.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

<p>In this part, we figure out the relation between goal rate and the two features shot distance and shot angle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_2_goal_rate_by_distance.PNG" alt="goal rate by distance" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_2_goal_rate_by_angle.PNG" alt="goal rate by angle" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The first figure shows that the closer the shot, the higher percentage it would become a goal. However, shots which are further than 160 ft have significantly higher goal rate than those from 40 to 80 ft, which is not very reasonable. It might because there were just a few shots taken from these very far distances, thus making the far-distance figures no more reliable.</li>
  <li>The second figure also implies the issues of using goal rate to evaluate hockey shots. For example, there is only one shot with angle 100 degree, and it was actually a goal. This makes the goal rate of the 100-degree shot reaches 100%, which does not make sense at all. From my point of views, we could weight the goal rate by a coefficient which is inversely proportional to shot counts to make the “goal rate” feature more useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>

<p>In this question, we try to discover potential issues which could occur in this dataset.</p>

<p>Specifically, we intuitively know that <strong>it is incredibly rare to score a non-empty net goal on the opposing team from within your defensive zone</strong>. Therefore, we plots figures of shot taken with empty net and non-empty net to confirm our expectation. If there were far-distance shots taken with non-empty net, we would try to find out the reasons.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_goal_non_empty_net_by_distance.PNG" alt="goal non empty net" /></p>

<p>The above figures do show that there were shots as we described (150 to 170 ft with non-empty net).</p>

<p>We investigate the processed dataset and realized there are wrong data indeed!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_wrong_coordinates.PNG" alt="wrong coordinates dataframe" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_wrong_coordinates_game.PNG" alt="wrong coordinates video" /></p>

<p>For instance, the shot at 01:24 (period 1) of the game between TBL and NYI (2020-09-10) has been recorded with wrong coordinates.</p>

<p>The dataframe shows that the shot was taken with coordinates [81, 2], while the net side being shot is on the left side, which is [-89, 0].</p>

<p>This makes the calculated shot distance wrong (170 ft), while the actual distance is very close to the net (as showing in the capture of the game that we took from the game’s recorded video). In fact, the actual coordinates were [-81, -2] instead.</p>

<p>We also investigate other similar shots and confirm that the recorded coordinates are wrong for all of those cases.</p>

<h2 id="task-3---baseline-models"><strong>Task 3 - Baseline Models</strong></h2>

<p>In this task, we consider simple models to learn a goal, a binary classification problem. The model will predict if a goal is achieved based on different features. Labels for goals is classified as “False” (non-goal) or “True” (goal). If it predicts a goal, (resp. non-goal) correctly, it will be a True Positive -TP (resp. True Negative - TN). If a goal is classified by a non-goal label, it is called False Negative - FN, otherwise, False Postive -FP.</p>

<p>The performance of the model can be explained partially by the accuracy score, defined as the ratio (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN), as well as, the confusion matrix.</p>

<p>Supervised machine learning technique used in this task will be the well-know Logistic Regression (Log-Reg). We will compare the performance of Log-Res with the trival non-learning predictions based on the uniform distribution. Two individual features and a combination of them will be feed to the model.</p>

<p>The traning size is 230999.</p>

<h3 id="question-1-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>We train the model by the Log-Res from samples (x_i, y_i) where x_i is the shot distance and y_i is the goal, that belongs to {0, 1} (or {False, True}).
The accuracy of this model is recorded at 90.51%, which means, the model can predict correctly 90.51% the goal rates. However, when coming to the f1-score, that represents the median of the recall and precision, it is 0% and the reason, we observed from the confusion matrix:
TP = 69689, FP = 7311, FN = 0, TN= 0, is that, the model seems to predict positive (True or Goal) all along.</p>

<h3 id="question-2-1">Question 2</h3>

<p>As per the guideline of the assignment, we are not including the plots here. Please check the next question where we have included all the figures.</p>

<h3 id="question-3-1">Question 3</h3>

<p>We now train the model by the Log-Res from samples (x_i, y_i) where x_i is the shot angle, and x_i =(shot distance, shot angle).
We observed the same phenomena with the accuracy and f1-score.</p>

<p>We briefly conclude that the logistic regression model always predicts Goals and the features involved did not make any difference. It suggests that more advanced model must be considered for this binary classfication problem which will be explored in the Tasks 5 and 6. We even compare the Log-Reg with the non-learning statistical technique.</p>

<p>The above plots depicted the results with the findings as it is obvious that the most successful model is the one combining both the distance and angle features. This model creates the most segmentation on our validation set. This model was one of the model out of the three that is able to predict the highest probability of goal for a shot. This model maximised the ROC AUC score under the curve out of the ones tested here.</p>

<p>The angle model on its own had some difficulty predicting goals. This is likely due to the fact that shots with high angle can be good depending on how far away the shot is, but low angle shots should produce the most scoring opportunities. Our model being unable to access the distance feature, it has difficulty making a sense of the angle feature.</p>

<p>The distance model on it own was performed as a reasonable model, but we see that adding the angle feature helps increase the model’s generalization.</p>

<h2 id="task-4---feature-engineering-ii"><strong>Task 4 - Feature Engineering II</strong></h2>

<p>For this task, we adjust the tidy data task from the previous milestone to add more necessary features and expect better performance of ML algorithms.</p>

<p>Specifically, the additional features are presented in the below table:</p>

<table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>disance from last event</td>
      <td>Distance (in feet) between the current shot and the previous event coordinates</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>is rebound</td>
      <td>A boolean variable indicating whether the shot is a rebound</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>change in shot angle</td>
      <td> The change in angle between two consecutive shots (in degree). Only in case the previous event was a shot or a goal, otherwise it's 0</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>num player home</td>
      <td>Number of home-team players at the time the shot was taken</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>num player away</td>
      <td>Number of away-team players at the time the shot was taken</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It should be noticed that we have already correct the wrong coordinates information to obtain this final dataframe.</p>

<p>For rebound shots, we include shots whose previous event were either a shot or a <strong>blocked shot</strong> (which is a bit different from the task’s suggestion).</p>

<p>Besides, we realized that there were many cases in which two consecutive shots were taken within a very large time interval (such as 22s), which should not be counted as rebounds. Therefore, we only consider a shot is a rebound if the time distance between it and its previous shot is less than 4 seconds.</p>

<p>We provide a dataframe containing all information of the game between Winnipeg and Washington on March 12, 2018 (game ID 2017021065):</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.comet.com/anshitasaxena/milestone-project-2/65623c06f8d44e94bc8c9214745a8417?experiment-tab=assets">dataframe could be found here</a></p>

<h2 id="task-5---advanced-models"><strong>Task 5 - Advanced Models</strong></h2>
<p>It is to note that for reproducibility purposes, we have used the seed. This will allow that wherever the code runs, it will produce same results.
As per the academic project guideline, we have trained and verified the results on the basis of following models:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Base Model - This model only uses the features = {‘distance’, ‘angle’}.</li>
  <li>More Features Model - This model uses the features = {‘game_seconds’, ‘shot_distance’, ‘shot_angle’, ‘period’, ‘x_shot’, ‘y_shot’, ‘shot_type’, ‘last_event_type’, ‘x_last_event’, ‘y_last_event’, ‘time_from_last_event’, ‘distance_from_last_event’, ‘is_rebound’, ‘change_in_shot_angle’, ‘speed’}</li>
  <li>Tuned Model - This model uses the same features as part of more features, however, we have added the hyperparameter tuning using several strategies, such as, Grid Search, Random Search, and Optuna (A powerful hyperparameter tuning framework)</li>
  <li>Feature Selection Model - This model is used for exploring the feature selection techniques using SHAP and Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validated (RFECV). Then, the model was trained after finding the best hyperparameters using the Randomized Search CV.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="question-1-2">Question 1</h3>
<p>The following are the four different curves:<br />
ROC/AUC <br />
Accuracy: 90.51% <br />
No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 <br />
XGBoost: ROC AUC=0.722 <br />
Here, we can see the accuracy and the proportion of area covered is 0.722.</p>

<p>For this baseline setup, we have split the dataset train and test set with train set as 80% and test set as 20%. After that, we have calculated the predictions. <br /> In comparison with the logistic regression, this model exceptionally performed.
We got the area under the curve 0.70 in logistic regression baseline model which was lower than this XGBoost model which acquired 0.722. Also, the reliability curves showed unable to hug the perfectly calibrated line much in baseline logistic regression which was not the case with this XGBoost model.<br />
As expected, the model architecture of XGB allows for a much more expressive model; this is notably reflected in the calibration curve improvements over the logistic regression.
We notice that as was showcased in Question 2 the correlation between the shot-angle and the goal probability is more noisy than the correlation between goals and distance; hence the slightly less optimal calibration of the model trained on the combination of features compared to using only distance.

<h3 id="question-2-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>We have firstly plot the four curves without any hyperparameter tuning and with the features suggested in part 4. We realized that the AUC_ROC curve area resulted into 0.757 without any hyperparameter tuning, however, AUC_ROC got increased to 0.763 using the hyperparameter tuning.

 }</li>
</ol>

<p>Best choosen parameters from this algorithm was:

<ol>
  <li>Optuna:

param = {
       “verbosity”: 1,
       “objective”: “binary:logistic”,
       # maximum depth of the tree, signifies complexity of the tree.
       “max_depth”: trial.suggest_int(“max_depth”, 3, 27, step=2),
       # minimum child weight, larger the term more conservative the tree.
       “min_child_weight”: trial.suggest_int(“min_child_weight”, 2, 26),

Best trial:
  Value: 0.7612592563321808
  Params:     n_estimators: 289.8115917562731</p>

<p>Hence, on the final tuned model, we applied the parameters:
params = {‘colsample_bytree’: 0.8, ‘gamma’: 1.5, ‘learning_rate’: 0.02,
            ‘max_depth’: 5, ‘n_estimators’: 600, ‘nthread’: 1, ‘silent’: True,
            ‘subsample’: 0.6}</p>

<p>With these parameters, we got high accuracy and higher area under ROC_AUC curve.
In comparison of the Baseline model, the tuned model performed better in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We got higher area under ROC_AUC curve which was 0.763, which was low i.e., 0.722 in the Baseline model.</li>
  <li>Additionally, it was observed that the reliability curve hugged the ‘perfectly caliberated’ curve in the tuned model which was not the case in the base model, the XGBoost curve was deflected highly apart from the ‘Perfectly Caliberated Curve’.</li>
</ol>

<p>Below are the four curves for the Tuned Model:
ROC/AUC<br />
No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 <br />
XGBoost: ROC AUC=0.76 <br />
Here, we can see the accuracy and the proportion of area covered is 0.76.</p>

<h3 id="question-3-2">Question 3</h3>

<p>We have applied several feature selection techniques, which includes the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>SHAP</li>
  <li>RFECV - Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to select features. This is the wrapper method which is used extensively in industrial basis setups.</li>
</ol>

<p>1.SHAP:
Using SHAP, we plotted prediction explanation, features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) to the model output. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, those pushing the prediction lower are in blue.
<img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q5_3_shap_waterfall.PNG" alt="Waterfall Plot" />
Next, we plotted mean absolute value of the SHAP values for each feature to get a standard bar plot.
<img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q5_3_shap_bar_plot.PNG" alt="Bar Plot" /></p>

<p>2.RFECV-
Using this method, we found the best features which were contributed towards the best accuracy of the model.
[‘onehotencoder__x0_Backhand’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Deflected’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Slap Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Snap Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Tip-In’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Wrap-around’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Wrist Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Blocked Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Faceoff’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Giveaway’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Hit’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Missed Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Takeaway’, ‘game_seconds’, ‘shot_distance’, ‘shot_angle’, ‘period’, ‘x_shot’, ‘y_shot’, ‘x_last_event’, ‘y_last_event’, ‘time_from_last_event’, ‘distance_from_last_event’, ‘is_rebound’, ‘change_in_shot_angle’, ‘speed’]</p>

<p>In comparison of the Baseline model, this new feature selected model performed better in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We got higher area under ROC_AUC curve 0.761, which was low i.e., 0.722 in the Baseline model.</li>
  <li>With these selected features, we got high accuracy 90.99% in this model which was lower in baseline model, i.e., 90.5%.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the best features, the accuracy of the model improved from 90.5% to 90.99%, however, we did not found any improvization in area under the AUC ROC curve.
Below are the four curves for the Best Feature selected Model:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ROC/AUC <br />
Accuracy: 90.99 <br />
No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 <br />
XGBoost: ROC AUC=0.76 <br /></li>

<p>Although there is a very minute difference between the Best Tuned model and the Best Feature Selected model, but we are selecting Best Tuned model as the best model on the basis of accuracy, area under the ROC AUC curves, reliability curves (it was observed that for most of the data points, it was hugging the perfectly caliberated line and the shot goal rate probability reaches maximum using model probability).</p>

<h2 id="task-6---give-it-the-best-shot"><strong>Task 6 - Give It the Best Shot!</strong></h2>

<h3 id="question-1-3">Question 1</h3>
<p>We have tried four models for this use case:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Light GBM</li>
  <li>Decision Trees</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
</ol>

<p>For feature selection, we tried the below four approaches:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RFE- Recursive Feature Elimination. This is the wrapper method, which is widely used in industries. We selected the top 25 features via this methodology:
[‘onehotencoder__x0_Slap Shot’,’onehotencoder__x0_Wrist Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Faceoff’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Hit’, ‘season’, ‘period’, ‘game_id’, ‘x_shot’, ‘y_shot’, ‘empty_net’, ‘home_goal’, ‘away_goal’, ‘is_rebound’, ‘game_seconds’, ‘x_last_event’, ‘y_last_event’, ‘time_from_last_event’, ‘num_player_home’, ‘num_player_away’, ‘time_power_play’, ‘shot_distance’, ‘shot_angle’, ‘change_in_shot_angle’, ‘distance_from_last_event’, ‘speed’]</li>
  <li>WOE - Feature selection via Weight of Evidence Technique. This method provided us the most important feature which should lie in the range of 0.3 to 0.5.
We found shot_distance feature as the most important feature.</li>
  <li>SelectKBest - With this method, we got the following top 25 features: [‘onehotencoder__x0_Slap Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Tip-In’, ‘onehotencoder__x0_Wrist Shot’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Faceoff’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Hit’, ‘onehotencoder__x1_Shot’, ‘season’, ‘period’, ‘x_shot’, ‘y_shot’, ‘empty_net’, ‘home_goal’, ‘away_goal’, ‘is_rebound’, ‘game_seconds’, ‘x_last_event’, ‘y_last_event’, ‘time_from_last_event’, ‘num_player_home’, ‘num_player_away’, ‘shot_distance’, ‘shot_angle’, ‘change_in_shot_angle’, ‘distance_from_last_event’, ‘speed’]</li>
</ol>

<p>After applying the above three different approaches, we extracted the final feature list by applying the intersection on all the four attributes:
[‘onehotencoder__x0_Wrist Shot’, ‘y_last_event’, ‘x_shot’, ‘home_goal’, ‘shot_distance’, ‘distance_from_last_event’, ‘y_shot’, ‘season’, ‘game_seconds’, ‘speed’, ‘num_player_away’, ‘num_player_home’, ‘change_in_shot_angle’, ‘empty_net’, ‘shot_angle’, ‘period’, ‘time_from_last_event’, ‘x_last_event’, ‘away_goal’]</p>

<p>For data-split and training data, we have converted all the categorical columns to numerical columns first using one-hot encoding. We used the 80% training data and 20% test data. We have also used the stratify parameter during the split to make the data distribution uniform among the classes. We have also used data standardization using StandardScalar.</p>

<p>For the hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, and Novel Metrics, we applied the below strategies: <br />
<b>1.Neural Network:</b> We tried the hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. Regularization techniques we have used the l2 regularization and Dropouts where it was observed that the performance of the model did not improved.<br /> We have compared the performance of the network using Accuracy and Loss Curves. Once the performance was achieved, we plotted the four curves and found that the area under the curve improved significantly from 0.76 to 0.83.<br /> We have also experienced the fact that without performing the feature selection techniques the accuracy and loss got stuck at a point which when we extracted features using the feature selection technique, it showed that the network started learning. We have also made sure by using BatchNormalization that at every input layer of neural network, the normalized inputs will be passed.<br />
We found the accuracy achieved using this method was 91.4% on validation set and AUC ROC was 0.832</p>

<p><b>2.Light GBM:</b> We tried the hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV technique. For regularization purposes, we have used the reg_alpha (L1 regularization) and reg_lambda (L2 regularization), both of these regularization parameters also tuned in the hyperparameter tuning.
We passed the parameters = {‘min_gain_to_split’:[0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6],”reg_alpha” :[0.4, 1], “reg_lambda” : [0.7, 1]} and found the best parameters = {‘reg_lambda’: 1, ‘reg_alpha’: 0.4, ‘min_gain_to_split’: 0.1}. We have plotted confusion matrix, classification report and feature importance graph.<br />
We found the accuracy achieved using this method was 89.90% on validation set and AUC_ROC was 0.847

<p>We found that most reliable out of all these four models were Neural Network and Light GBM because of their accuracy, area under ROC_AUC, their goal rate probability. Hence, we tried to plot the comparison between these two models as well using the caliberation matrix.
<img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q6_1_Caliberative Curve comparison between Light GBM and Neural Network.png" alt="Caliberative Comparison Curve" /></p>

<p>Hence, this from predictions caliberation curve displays that for most of the data points, Neural Network is best fitted with the reliability curve. With accuracy 91.4% on validation set and AUC ROC was 0.832, we conclude Neural Network as our best model.</p>

<p>Being tested on the regular 2020 season: logistic regression is not performing better on the testing data, with the accuracy of 90.11% and a bias in predicting “GOAL”. XBoots has the same accuracy of 90.37%. The best model is still NN. In fact, all our models seem to be performing as good as on the validation set which is a good sign that our chosen models are robust to overfitting the data it’s trained on.</p>

<h3 id="question-2-4">Question 2</h3>

<p>On the playoff data for 2020 season: we observed that the NN still performs better while being tested. Even the logistic regresion has a higher accuracy of 91.44% in comparison with XBoost (73.97%), which is the worse candidate in this testing data, it is still predicting “GOAL” all along.</p>

<p>By looking at results from playoffs, we see that the results have a higher variability. This can be explained by multiple factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Playoffs are a smaller subset of data than a regular season which will cause more unstable results.</li>
  <li>COVID had just hit and players got a prolonged break before playoffs which might have impacted performance.</li>
  <li>Playoff hockey is inherently different than regular season hockey. Players are more invested in the result of every single games and facing the same team multiple times in a row leave time for the teams to optimise their gameplay for their specific opponent. Furthermore, only the better teams are playing and advancing which often have better goalies making it harder for shooters to score.</li>
</ol>
