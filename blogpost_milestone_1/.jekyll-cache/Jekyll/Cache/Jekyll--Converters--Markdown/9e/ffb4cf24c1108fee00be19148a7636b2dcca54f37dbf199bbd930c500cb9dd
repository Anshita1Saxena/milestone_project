<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>From the tidied dataset with information of all shots and goals, we added several features: ‚Äúshot distance‚Äù, ‚Äúshot angle‚Äù, ‚Äúis goal‚Äù and ‚Äúempty net‚Äù.</p>

<p>With these information, we could plot the following figures:</p>

<p><strong>Shot counts by distance</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_distance.PNG" alt="shot counts by distance" /></p>

<p>According to the above figure, it is obvious that most shots and goals were taken from distance 5 to 70 ft, which is intuitive and reasonable. The highest number of shots and goals were at distance around 15 ft, while there were just a few shots were taken at the defensive side of each team (greater than 100 ft).</p>

<p><strong>Shot counts by angle</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_angle.PNG" alt="shot counts by angle" /></p>

<p>The histogram of shot counts binned by shot angle indicates that hockey shooters prefer front shots (with angle from 0 to 45 degree) than shots from the two sides with too large angle. It is understandable because if a shot is taken with a very large angle, it would easier to miss.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that there were several shots with angle greater than 90 degree. This mean the hockey players took the shots from behind the net, which is very impressive!</p>

<p><strong>Shot by both distance and angle from the net</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_1_shot_by_distance_and_angle.PNG" alt="shot distance and angle" /></p>

<p>By combining both the feature shot distance and shot angle, we realize that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All shots from angle greater than 90 degree are taken near the net. It is obivous because the maximum distance behind the net is just around 25 ft. However, it partly proves that our feature engineering process has been done suitably.</li>
  <li>All far-distance shots were taken at angle 0 to 25 degree. This does make sense because if a hockey player shots too near from the net with very high angle, the shot would highly likely hit the goal post.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

<p>In this part, we figure out the relation between goal rate and the two features shot distance and shot angle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_2_goal_rate_by_distance.PNG" alt="goal rate by distance" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_2_goal_rate_by_angle.PNG" alt="goal rate by angle" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The first figure shows that the closer the shot, the higher percentage it would become a goal. However, shots which are further than 160 ft have significantly higher goal rate than those from 40 to 80 ft, which is not very reasonable. It might because there were just a few shots taken from these very far distances, thus making the far-distance figures no more reliable.</li>
  <li>The second figure also implies the issues of using goal rate to evaluate hockey shots. For example, there is only one shot with angle 100 degree, and it was actually a goal. This makes the goal rate of the 100-degree shot reaches 100%, which does not make sense at all. From my point of views, we could weight the goal rate by a coefficient which is inversely proportional to shot counts to make the ‚Äúgoal rate‚Äù feature more useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>

<p>In this question, we try to discover potential issues which could occur in this dataset.</p>

<p>Specifically, we intuitively know that <strong>it is incredibly rare to score a non-empty net goal on the opposing team from within your defensive zone</strong>. Therefore, we plots figures of shot taken with empty net and non-empty net to confirm our expectation. If there were far-distance shots taken with non-empty net, we would try to find out the reasons.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_goal_non_empty_net_by_distance.PNG" alt="goal non empty net" /></p>

<p>The above figures do show that there were shots as we described (150 to 170 ft with non-empty net).</p>

<p>We investigate the processed dataset and realized there are wrong data indeed!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_wrong_coordinates.PNG" alt="wrong coordinates dataframe" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/milestone2_q2_3_wrong_coordinates_game.PNG" alt="wrong coordinates video" /></p>

<p>For instance, the shot at 01:24 (period 1) of the game between TBL and NYI (2020-09-10) has been recorded with wrong coordinates.</p>

<p>The dataframe shows that the shot was taken with coordinates [81, 2], while the net side being shot is on the left side, which is [-89, 0].</p>

<p>This makes the calculated shot distance wrong (170 ft), while the actual distance is very close to the net (as showing in the capture of the game that we took from the game‚Äôs recorded video). In fact, the actual coordinates were [-81, -2] instead.</p>

<p>We also investigate other similar shots and confirm that the recorded coordinates are wrong for all of those cases.</p>
