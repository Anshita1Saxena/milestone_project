## Milestone 1
## Question Codes and Figures:

Question 1 Data Acquisition (25%):-
The builded the code `download_raw_data.ipynb` which is placed in the directory `milestone_project/src/data/`. As per suggested by TA, we didn't place the downloaded data in the data directory folder.

Question 2 Interactive Debugging Tool (10%):-
The notebook of ipywidget intractive tool is placed in `milestone_project/notebooks/ipywidgets.ipynb`

Question 3 Tidy Data (10%):-
The code is placed in `tidy_data_add.py` which is placed in `milestone_project/src/features`. The data `complex_visuals.csv` generated by this file is placed in the `milestone_project/data/processed/`.

Question 4 Simple Visualizations (25%):-
The code is placed in `simple visualizations.ipynb` along with the plots.

Question 5 Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps (30%):-
There are two codes for this question. The data aggregation code `complex_visuals_data.py` is placed in `milestone_project/src/visualization/` and the data visualization code `advanced_visuals_plotly.py` is placed in `milestone_project/src/visualization/`. The aggregated data `complex_diff.csv` generated is placed in `milestone_project/data/processed`. The interactive plot `Milestone1_Q_6_1.html` is placed in `milestone_project/reports/figures`. Additionally, we have launched it as a website: `https://advancedvisuals.herokuapp.com/`.

Comet-ml was setup and the link for this comet-ml is available here: `https://www.comet.com/anshitasaxena/milestone-project-2/view/new/experiments`

Question 2 (10%):-
The code is present under `src/features` directory, namely `milestone2_feature_engineering.py` and `milestone2_tidy_data.py`. Images are placed under the blogpost `Assets` directory. And visualization kept in `src/visualization` in the code `milestone2_visualization_feature_engineering_I.py`.

Question 3 (15%):-
The code is present under the `src/model` directory, namely `basemodel_logreg.py` and it's notebook is present under `notebook` directory namely `basemodel_logreg.ipynb`.

Question 4 (15% + bonus 5%):-
The code is present under `src/features` directory, namely `milestone2_feature_engineering.py` and `milestone2_tidy_data.py`. Images are placed under the blogpost `Assets` directory. 

Question 5 (20%):-
